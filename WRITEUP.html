<h2>Running</h2>
If you would like to run code that generated these results, simply do<br>
<code>./main.py</code><br>
<h2>Generating the Data Set</h2>
<p>
I wrote a flexible parser/decoder for the MIT-CMU face dataset (dataprep/
dataprep.py). It handles
the images themselves and parses the associated ground-truth data. Thanks to
this decoder, I was able to create and recreate the training data sets quickly
and easily explore different variables.<br>
Besides making the facial mosaics,
the system can compute the "random" mosaics. It selects random patches
from random images and makes sure that they do not overlap with any faces.<br>
One interesting parameter that I varied while constructing the data set was
an "expansion" factor. This factor determined how much beyond the 
top/bottom/left/right of the marked face to include. I settled on a 20% increase
beyond the initial markings which made the detectors perform the best.<br>
Average face:<br>
<img src=actual/face-average.gif height=120 width=120>(enlarged by 10x)<br>
Average random:<br>
<img src=actual/random-average.gif height=120 width=120>(enlarged by 10x)<br>
<img src=actual/mosaic-full.gif><br>
This system also made it possible for me to create other mosaics that I used
to evaluate the detectors. See below for results.
</p>
<h2>Constructing the Gaussian</h2>
<p>
I used the training data and the pseudo-invserse calculations to generate
parameters for a Gaussian distribution for the set of face and the set of
random patches. <br>
Calculating the pseudo inverse of the covariance matrix involves singular
value decomposition. The matrixes of the SVD of Sigma can be truncated
based on the singular values of the diagonal matrix. <br>
<img src=face-tau-graph.png><br>
<img src=random-tau-graph.png><br>
These graphs make the "knee" point obvious.
Based on these graphs, I selected tau = 1x10-8 as a truncation point. This
reduced the size of the matrixes in the SVD to approximately 100 (from 144).<br>
Code for the Gaussian detector is in gaussian.py.
</p>
<h2>Construction the Linear Classifier</h2>
<p>
Constructing the linear classifier was tricky, but fun! I had a difficult time
building the learning mechanism -- I initially did not let it iterate 
long enough. Once I got the learning to converge, the classifier produced
excellent results! I used a learning rate of 0.001, a convergence factor of
0.00001 and a maximum of 300 iterations to learn.<br>
<img src=learning-graph.png><br>
The value converges very quickly but them takes a number of iterations to
reach my very small convergence value. The classifier was far more sensitive
to the learning rate than the convergence factor. A higher learning rate
meant that the differences at each iteration would flip/flop +/- as they
neared convergence.<br>
Code for the Linear Classifier is in logreg.py.
</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Self Tests</h3>
I first tested the Gaussian and Linear Classifier detectors on the 
training data.

<h3>External Testing</h3>
<p>
For more in-depth testing, I constructed a series of testing images. Each test
input is described along with the results.<br>
To find faces outside the MIT-CMU dataset, I used the
<a href=https://www.bioid.com/About/BioID-Face-Database>BioID face database</a>.
In particular, I used the faces from 1501, 1447 and 1379. <br>
The random backgrounds were constructed in 4 steps:<br>
<ol>
<li>Started with a fractal.
<li>Applied a wave transformation
<li>Blurred it.
<li>Added a perlin noise layer.
</ol>
For the test images with solid backgrounds, I choose the red image 
because a flat black background made the detectors go wild. I think that
there was too much change between the faces and the black background 
which caused many false positives.<br>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
Based on my experimentation with the Gaussian and Linear Classifier detectors,
it seems that the Gaussian detector works reasonably well on images that are
very similar to those in the training set. <br>
Both detectors find almost all of the faces in the mosaics of face patches.
However, the Gaussian detector is far more likely to mark random patches 
as faces than the Linear Classifier detector. Overall, the Guassian 
detector is far more likely to produce false positives than the 
Linear Classifier detector.<br>
The non-mosaic test inputs reinforce the conclusion that the Gaussian detector
works well on inputs that are similar to the training set. For example, the Gaussian detector
works well on solidbg, solidbg2, solidbg2, randombg, randombg2, and randombg6.
It does not, however, work well for the test inputs that contain images
from outside the training set (solidbg-biod, randombg-biod, etc). The test
input images that contain faces from outside the training set show the power
of the Linear Classifier detector. This discrepancy is even more obvious
in the "pyramid" detector. 
<h2>Detecting Faces of Different Resolutions.</h2>
A "pyramid" detector makes it possible to detect variable-sized faces 
with detectors that are trained to detect fixed-sized faces.
The idea is that the input image is repeatedly scaled down and handed to the
fixed-size face detector. Given enough iterations, faces of all different 
resolutions will eventually be 12x12 and, therefore, recognizable to our 
detector.<br>
The original input image is blurred before it is downscaled. This will prevent
aliasing. A Gaussian blur is applied with a sigma value that is proporational
to the scaling factor. Accoring to the <a href=http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.transform.html#skimage.transform.pyramid_gaussian>skimage website</a> and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule>math</a>, a feasible
sigma is 2*scale/6.0. Note that even though I am referring to the 
documentation of the image pyramid generating function from skimage, I <i>did not</i> use that in my implementation. I found that a scale of 1.1 and 
maximum of 25 layers made the pyramid detector work reasonably well. In other
words, the image was downscaled by a factor of 1.1 25 times (or the image 
could not be downscaled any further, whichever came first).<br>
My pyramid detector includes non maximal suppression in two places: at each 
scale and then globally. This technique meant that only the "best" faces
at each scale are detected and only the best faces across scales are included
in the final results. <br>
Code for the pyramid detector is in main.py in the pyramid_find_faces function.

<h3>Discussion</h3>
As I said earlier, the Guassian detector works best detecting faces that
are very similar to its training data. As a result, it performs poorly in 
most of these tests. However, as bas as the Gaussian detector is, the Linear
Classifier detector works surprisingly well. <br>
In general, the more the image is scaled the more false positives there are. 
Each blur/scale increases how much the face bleeds into the background which
produces false positives (especially with the sensitive Gaussian detector).
