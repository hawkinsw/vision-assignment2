How did I make the random background? 
1. Started with a fractal.
2. Applied a wave transformation
3. Blurred it.
4. Added a perlin noise layer.

Why did I use "red" as the background color for the solid bg images?
Black seemed to make it too sensitive. I think that there was too much change
between the faces and the black background and there were way too many false 
positives.
